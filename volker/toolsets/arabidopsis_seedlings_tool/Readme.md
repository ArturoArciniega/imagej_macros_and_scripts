It can be run in batch mode on a series of images. It writes a spreadsheet file with the measured area per well and saves a control image showing the green surface that has been detected per well.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/MontpellierRessourcesImagerie/imagej_macros_and_scripts/wiki/Arabidopsis-Seedlings-Tool) of the tool for details.
