# Analyse Spots Per Protoplast

The tool counts the spots per protoplast. If a third channel is provided it is used to filter out detected protoplasts that do not have exactly one nucleus. The tool expects a hyperstack with the channels  

1. spots (green)
1. protoplasts (grey)
1. nuclei (blue, optional)
