Find molecules as spots in scale-space and amassments by merging overlapping spots.

This is a variant of the [Automatic_Scale_Spot_Detection_Tool](https://github.com/MontpellierRessourcesImagerie/imagej_macros_and_scripts/wiki/Automatic_Scale_Spot_Detection_Tool). The scale space linking in this tool is simplified and will not always give correct results but the error is irrelevant for the application case.

 You need to have [FeatureJ](https://imagej.net/ImageScience) by [Erik Meijering](https://imagej.net/User:ImageScience) installed.
