Analyze the clustering behavior of nuclei in 3D images. The centers of the nuclei are detected. The nuclei are filtered by the presence of a signal in a different channel.  They clustered with the density based algorithm DBSCAN. The nearest neighbor distances between all nuclei and those outside and inside of the clusters are calculated.

See the [wiki of the tool](https://github.com/MontpellierRessourcesImagerie/imagej_macros_and_scripts/wiki/3D_Nuclei_Clustering_Tool) for details.
