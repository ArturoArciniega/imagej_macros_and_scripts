# MRI_ND_To_Hyperstack

The tools converts images in the .nd format to ImageJ hyperstacks. The user selects an .nd file. An image can consist of multiple positions, frames, z-slices and channels. Each position is converted into an ImageJ hyperstack and written into a subfolder of the folder containing the input image.

Please find more information on the [wiki page](https://github.com/MontpellierRessourcesImagerie/imagej_macros_and_scripts/wiki/MRI_ND_To_Hyperstack) of the tool.
