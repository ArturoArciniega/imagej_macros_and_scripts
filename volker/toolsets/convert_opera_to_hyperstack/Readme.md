The tool converts images taken with the Opera into hyperstacks. The image names are in the form

r02c04f01p01-ch1sk1fk1fl1.tiff

where r is the row, c the column, f the field, p the z-position and ch the channel. The tool converts all images in the input folder. You can find an example image here: image.zip. Download and unzip it and run the tool on the image folder.
