# Intensity Per Nucleus Tool

The tool segments the nuclei in the dapi or hoechst channel of the image and measures the mean intensity per nuclei in the other channels of the image. The macro can be applied recursively to all images in a folder and its subfolders.

See the wiki-page of the tool for details: [Intensity-Per-Nucleus-Tool](https://github.com/MontpellierRessourcesImagerie/imagej_macros_and_scripts/wiki/Intensity-Per-Nucleus-Tool)
