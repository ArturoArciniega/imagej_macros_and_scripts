In images from transmission electron microscopy of the optic nerve, calculate the g-ratio of the axons. The pg-factor and the ag-factor will be measured. The pg-factor is the inner perimeter of the neuron divided by the outer perimeter including the myelin. The ag-factor is the square-root of the area of the inner surface divided by the area of the outer surface including the myelin. 

See the [tool's wiki-page](https://github.com/MontpellierRessourcesImagerie/imagej_macros_and_scripts/wiki/MRI_g_ratio_Tools) for more information.
