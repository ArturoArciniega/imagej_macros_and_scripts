# Analyze Cardiomyocytes

Analyze images from second harmonics microscopy of cardiac muscle cells (cardiomyocytes). The tool measures the length of the sarcomeres using the FFT of the image and the degree of organization of the sarcomeres by using the dispersion provided by the Directonality command of FIJI.
