Analyze calcium signals in dendritic spines. The images consist of time-series of calcium signals. Each image contains a selection that marks the point of stimulation. The tool finds the region to analyze close to the point of stimulation. It measures the intensity of the calcium signal in the whole region of interest and in the segmented spots.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/MontpellierRessourcesImagerie/imagej_macros_and_scripts/wiki/Analyze_Calcium_Signals_In_Spines) of the tool for details.
