The tool creates images of 2D-spots for the evaluation and benchmarking of spot detection tools. Two populations of spots with different means and variations of the size can be created in the same image.

See the wiki-page of the tool for details: [MRI_Create_Synthetic_Spots_Tool](https://github.com/MontpellierRessourcesImagerie/imagej_macros_and_scripts/wiki/MRI_Create_Synthetic_Spots_Tool)
